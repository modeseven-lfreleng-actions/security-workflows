Reusable GitHub Actions workflows that scan and audit Linux Foundation
projects for security and supply-chain risk. Each workflow is a
standalone **lane**: a caller invokes it directly, alongside whatever
build pipeline the project already runs.

These lanes are ecosystem-agnostic. Nexus IQ CLM, for example, serves
Maven, Gradle and Node.js projects alike, which is why they live here
rather than in a language-specific repository such as
[`java-workflows`](https://github.com/lfreleng-actions/java-workflows).

## Status

**Under construction.** This repository starts from
`workflows-template`, drops its generic build/test/release skeletons,
and picks up the security lanes from
`lfit/releng-reusable-workflows`, which retires once they land.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Lane | Purpose | Status |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| `sonatype-lifecycle.yaml` | Nexus IQ CLM dependency scan, with optional pre-scan build | **Available** |
| `sonarqube-cloud.yaml` | SonarQube Cloud static analysis, with optional pre-scan build | **Available** |
| `zizmor.yaml` | GitHub Actions workflow audit, SARIF publishing | **Available** |
| `openssf-scorecard.yaml` | OpenSSF Scorecard supply-chain health | Planned |
| `package-hardening-audit.yaml` | Package manager hardening audit | **Available** |
| `codeql.yaml` | CodeQL static analysis | Planned |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Until a lane lands, continue using its counterpart in
`lfit/releng-reusable-workflows`. A migration map ships with the
first release.

## Design

Read [`docs/BRIEF.md`](docs/BRIEF.md) for the design decisions: why the
lanes live in a dedicated repository, how they compose with build
pipelines, the input vocabulary they share, and the per-lane Gerrit
posture.

## Composition

Lanes are **standalone**. They never call one another, and they never
call a build workflow. Composition happens in the caller:

```text
.github/workflows/gerrit-clm.yaml     -> sonatype-lifecycle.yaml
.github/workflows/gerrit-verify.yaml  -> java-workflows/maven-build-test.yaml
```

This is deliberate. Reusable workflows that reference each other across
repositories must be SHA-pinned, so every release of one forces a bump
in the other; composing at the caller avoids that entirely. Where a lane
genuinely needs a build first (the CLM lane, which scans resolved
dependencies), it runs the build itself via a `build_type` input rather
than calling out to another workflow.

## Gerrit support

Lanes are Gerrit-aware: a caller that sets `gerrit_refspec` gets a
change checked out with `checkout-gerrit-change-action` in place of
`actions/checkout`. Vote and comment casting belong in the caller, never
inside the lanes themselves; each lane's `gerrit.yaml` example shows the
shape.

One exception, enforced upstream rather than by choice:
**`openssf-scorecard.yaml` cannot support Gerrit.** `ossf/scorecard-action`
restricts which steps may run in its job, and its publish API rejects
anything else with HTTP 400. A Gerrit checkout action cannot run there.
Scorecard also scores a GitHub repository as a whole, so a per-change
scan would tell you nothing useful in any case.

## Usage

Each lane ships two callers under `examples/<lane>/`, added alongside
the lane itself. Copy one into your project's `.github/workflows/`
directory and replace the placeholder `uses:` SHA with a pinned release:

- `github.yaml` — a plain GitHub-native caller.
- `gerrit.yaml` — a Gerrit-wrapped caller for projects where Gerrit is
  the source of truth, integrating with `gerrit_to_platform`
  voting/commenting.

Inputs are optional and default to the canonical behaviour; read the
`inputs:` block at the top of each workflow for the documented list.

## Conventions

Shared with `python-`, `go-`, `node-` and `java-workflows`:

- Workflow `name:` prefixed `[R]`; no `reuse-` filename prefix.
- Top-level `permissions: {}`, explicit least-privilege per job, and
  `timeout-minutes` on every job.
- A `gerrit-validate` job as the DAG root, failing fast when a caller
  supplies `gerrit_refspec` without the project, branch and URL the
  Gerrit checkout also needs.
- Harden-runner on every network-touching job: block mode by default,
  with `harden_runner_egress: 'audit'` as an explicit opt-out. Anything
  other than `audit` means block, so a typo cannot weaken the posture.
- Every `uses:` pinned to a full **commit** SHA (never an annotated tag
  object) with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment.
- `persist-credentials: false` on every checkout.
- Never interpolate `${{ }}` into `run:` blocks; env-mediate instead.
- `zizmor --persona auditor` must report zero findings.
